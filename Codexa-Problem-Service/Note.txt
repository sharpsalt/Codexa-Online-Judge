We have going to be Ideally two branches at startign one is master branch and one is main branch
How the seggregation of branches work?

Whenever we will have a deployment ready service or code , we will only deploy the main branch
Let's say all the active development, mergin or creation of feature, all those got mergd to master node,where we can have all the tests etc 
when the master is in good situation then you push your code to main branch 


Generally in companies there will be many many branches 
Like main branch, master branch, test_deployment bracnh, active_dev branch

So in our case we will make our Active_Deployment branch as master branch 

Run the command

git checkout -b master

When you run this you will switch to new branch 'Master'
It is a good practice 


Different Company have Different things 
Master branch will be one where we will do active development 
we are not having Active_Deployment branch because we have not QA Folks, or testers around

Generally in Companies there are QA's
whenever we have to deploy new feature we first pass it to QA 
where QA test the festure, and then the feature get deployed to that  , but we don;t have that much that's why we skip it


Different company have different version control system 
Eg-Google have no git
Google have piper, like it is a very different thing altogether 

Piper is alternative of git
