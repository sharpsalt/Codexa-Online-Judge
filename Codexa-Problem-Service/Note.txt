We have going to be Ideally two branches at startign one is master branch and one is main branch
How the seggregation of branches work?

Whenever we will have a deployment ready service or code , we will only deploy the main branch
Let's say all the active development, mergin or creation of feature, all those got mergd to master node,where we can have all the tests etc 
when the master is in good situation then you push your code to main branch 


Generally in companies there will be many many branches 
Like main branch, master branch, test_deployment bracnh, active_dev branch

So in our case we will make our Active_Deployment branch as master branch 

Run the command

git checkout -b master

When you run this you will switch to new branch 'Master'
It is a good practice
