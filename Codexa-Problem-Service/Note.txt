We have going to be Ideally two branches at startign one is master branch and one is main branch
How the seggregation of branches work?

Whenever we will have a deployment ready service or code , we will only deploy the main branch
Let's say all the active development, mergin or creation of feature, all those got mergd to master node,where we can have all the tests etc 
when the master is in good situation then you push your code to main branch 


Generally in companies there will be many many branches 
Like main branch, master branch, test_deployment bracnh, active_dev branch

So in our case we will make our Active_Deployment branch as master branch 

Run the command

git checkout -b master

When you run this you will switch to new branch 'Master'
It is a good practice 


Different Company have Different things 
Master branch will be one where we will do active development 
we are not having Active_Deployment branch because we have not QA Folks, or testers around

Generally in Companies there are QA's
whenever we have to deploy new feature we first pass it to QA 
where QA test the festure, and then the feature get deployed to that  , but we don;t have that much that's why we skip it


Different company have different version control system 
Eg-Google have no git
Google have piper, like it is a very different thing altogether 

Piper is alternative of git



if my request is in json format so it is necessary to write url encoded?
//No but if you are using postman then while setting up postman body write raw json is pretty hectic while the url encoded is prtty easy 
there can be situation where you want to take input from the frontend in the form of urlencoded strings then in that case too it will be useful too






POSTMAN 
_______
Postman Open kro and go to Collectio tags and open new Collection 
Collection is the group of request tht you want to have 
so rename your new Collection to Codexa-Problem-service
and after renaming click on that collection and then click on new request 
in the new request give the localhost:3000/ping because we are having ping as an APi for ping checking phir uspe request bhejdo 
to get the correct answer



In POSTMAN we can actually define a variable 
like instead of localhost:3000 we can set it as variable 
Use case of variable?
if at any point you are suing smehting very frequently like something called as base address then at that time we can set it as variable 
like we don't need to write it again and again 
our alias for the variable would be wrapped by double curly braces 

suppose we have added new api or service so at that time we can simply use that variable 

for example if the value of dev_server changes , like if you want to test it on production then there would be different url for production service 
but if by any mean if we shifted rom production then in every place we hve to change the value of it 
so instead of it we can simply use variable like it will be super easy for anyone

Let's do one thing , create a brand new feature branch 

so i will create it 

srijan-verma@Srijan-Dell-G15:~/Codes/Web Dev/Project/Codexa$ git checkout -b Feature_Setp_MVC_for_problem_spi

whenever there is a feature whcih you want to add, it is recommended that name the branch from feature , if you want to bug fix or hot fix then do that for themselved




Now we will startup by setting up layers
controllers
routes
services
utils
validators
config
repositories



//In our Admin Dashboard, either we can give end user or we can use somthing called as markdown
Markdown is more of like markup language more of like html 
with markdown you can add syntax  alignment,code snippet, or you want to add dropdown 
bare minimum like adding images or videos bhi kr kste 
//so we will be storing things for problem statement in markdown


All of these request we will be able to do because of middleware based architechture

because of middleware like architechture, you can see like this apiRouter will also acts as middleware 
what's the special thing about final middleware?

qki final middleware, is the point from which later we are forwarding request to the service layers thats why we are calling it as controllers

because the remaining middleware have different-different works
